## Analysing the Attack with Wazuh
As the attacks were going on, each stage of the attack would have triggered a monitor in Wazuh, which would have triggered an alert. in real-time, a Admin or professional tasked with looking after the enterprise would have seen these alerts, and would know in real time what the attacker is doing, whether it is recon or privilege escalation from the alert, and they can respond effectively and quickly.
