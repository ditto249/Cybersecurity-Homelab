# Cybersecurity Homelab (ProjectSecurity E101)

This repository documents my implementation of the [ProjectSecurity E101 Homelab](https://docs.projectsecurity.io/e101/overview) by Grant Collins.  

The lab simulates a small enterprise environment to practice core defensive and offensive security skills.  
Although I followed the guide closely, I used the build process to troubleshoot, explore configurations, and develop my own study notes, which are included here.

## üñ•Ô∏è Lab Overview

The environment replicates an enterprise network with Active Directory, workstations, servers, and both defensive and offensive security tooling.  

**Core components:**  
- **Domain Controller** (Windows Server 2025 ‚Äì AD, DNS, DHCP, SSO)  
- **Corporate Server** (Ubuntu Server ‚Äì email & applications) Used a Docker container to run Mialhog as our SMTP server.
- **Windows & Linux Clients** (employee workstations)  
- **Security Servers** (Security Onion, Ubuntu Desktop for monitoring)  
- **Attacker Machine** (Kali Linux ‚Äì adversary simulation)

## üîß Tools & Technologies

**Enterprise & Defense:**  
- Microsoft Active Directory  
- Wazuh (SIEM)  
- Security Onion (IDS/Monitoring)  
- MailHog (Email testing)  

**Offense / Red Teaming:**  
- Evil-WinRM  
- Hydra  
- SecLists  
- NetExec  
- XFreeRDP

## üéØ Skills Practiced

- Built and configured a Windows domain environment with multiple hosts  
- Set up centralized logging and monitoring (Wazuh, Security Onion)  
- Practiced log analysis, detection engineering, and SIEM queries  
- Simulated phishing and reverse shell attacks in a controlled lab  
- Troubleshot common networking and configuration issues

## üìö Learning Notes

I created my own study notes to reinforce understanding:  
- [Active Directory Setup & Concepts](notes/active-directory.md)  
- [SIEM & Log Analysis with Wazuh](notes/siem-wazuh.md)  
- [Detection Engineering with Sigma](notes/detection-engineering.md)  
- [Troubleshooting & Fixes](notes/troubleshooting.md)

## ‚ö° Challenges & Troubleshooting

Some examples of where I had to troubleshoot during the lab:  
- **Networking issues** ‚Äì fixed NAT and DHCP scope conflicts  
- **Logs not ingesting** ‚Äì corrected Sysmon config for Splunk/Wazuh pipelines  
- **IDS performance drops** ‚Äì tuned Security Onion and filtered noisy alerts  
- **Domain join errors** ‚Äì resolved via DNS/AD configuration changes
